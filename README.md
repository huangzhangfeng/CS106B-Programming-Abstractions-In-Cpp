# CS106B-Programming-Abstractions-In-Cpp
Course Overview Students coming to CS106B are expected to have substantial prior experience with programming constructs such as loops, functions/methods, arrays, console and file I/O, standard data types (integer, string, and floating point), and classes. In other words, students coming to CS106B are expected to know how to write code. In this course, we transform you from someone who knows how to write some code into someone who can wield the power of the computer in a more expansive, versatile, and fluent way. This course adds powerful new tools to your skillset: managing complexity through abstraction, using recursion to crack big, tough problems by breaking them into smaller solvable problems, and applying analytical tools to evaluate the efficiency of different software design choices.
